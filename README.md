# 📘 Learning Mini Projects Repository

This repository contains **mini projects, practice exercises, and code experiments** that I build while learning from various online resources such as:

- freeCodeCamp 
- YouTube tutorials
- Blogs and documentation
- Other open educational resources

The main goal of this repository is to **track my learning progress, stay consistent, and practice by building**.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice concepts by implementing them in small projects
- Reinforce learning through hands-on coding
- Maintain consistency and learning discipline
- Create a public learning log on GitHub
- Improve problem-solving and coding confidence over time

This is **not a showcase of original or production-level projects**, but a reflection of my learning journey.
